# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I have a degree in Accounting and Information systems 
- I am taking STATS 220 because I need a level 2 stats to be able to get into my honors 
- I am interested in learning about data and coding 

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
